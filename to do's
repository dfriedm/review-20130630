today:
1 get sessions tests to pass
2 add seed data (cn flashcards)
3 flesh out sessions tdd - need study methods, spaced rep etc
4 flesh out cards tdd



-----------------------------------
create migrations for each of the other models

flesh out other methods

begin building out the runtime in flash_card_app.rb\


for study session:
# make a study session class
# study methods: all, shuffle, ordered, alphabetical, spaced repitition
# spaced repitition gets long medium and short times--- maybe it's own class, marked as known, not known

# flashcard_app.rb -> make the main
# start, exit, settings, build a deck vs test... etc

# require_relative '../../environment'
------


for deck:
 # shuffle, reset, next

  # card_studied, studied today
  # active, inactive?, plus days

  # set study session repitition- when due next
  # scheduler
  # start thinking about end point and
